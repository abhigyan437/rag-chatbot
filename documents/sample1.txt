Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. Examples include classification and regression problems.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
- Training data: The dataset used to train the model
- Features: Individual measurable properties of observed phenomena
- Model: The mathematical representation of a real-world process
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Cross-validation: A technique to assess model performance

Applications of machine learning span across various industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.
