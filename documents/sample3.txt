Data Science and Analytics

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from structured and unstructured data.

The Data Science Process:
1. Problem Definition: Clearly defining the business problem or research question
2. Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources
3. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data patterns and relationships
5. Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features for modeling
6. Model Building: Applying appropriate algorithms to solve the problem
7. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics
8. Deployment: Implementing the solution in a production environment
9. Monitoring: Continuously tracking model performance and updating as needed
